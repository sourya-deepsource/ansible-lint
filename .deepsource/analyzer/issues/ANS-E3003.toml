Executing a command when there is an Ansible module is not recommended.

Ansible has two generic ways of performing a task, using Ansible modules or using the `command`/`shell` module.  Ansible modules are developed by the Ansible community and third party vendors like `rpm` , `docker` , `kubernetes` , `yum` , `azure` etc.

`command` module allows you to run a shell command without actually invoking the shell but using command module is a bad idea, since itâ€™s not idempotent in nature, the developer is responsible for handling the idempotency of the task.

## Example

### Bad practice

```yml
- name: reboot the servers
  command: /sbin/reboot -t now
```

### Recommended

Use an Ansible module with arguments.

```yml
- name: restart webserver
  service:
    name: httpd
    state: restarted
```
