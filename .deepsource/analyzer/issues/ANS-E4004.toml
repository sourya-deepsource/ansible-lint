`copy` and `template` do not need to use relative path for `src`.

Example of using `src` :

```yml
- name: Copy file with owner and permissions
  copy:
    src: /srv/myfiles/foo.conf
    dest: /etc/foo.conf
    owner: foo
    group: foo
    mode: '0644'
```

Example with using `template`:

```yml
- name: Template a file to /etc/file.conf
  template:
    src: /mytemplates/foo.j2
    dest: /etc/file.conf
    owner: bin
    group: wheel
    mode: '0644'
```
